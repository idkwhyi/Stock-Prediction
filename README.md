# Stock Prediction Using Python

Welcome to the **Stock Prediction Using Python** repository! This project demonstrates the use of Python and machine learning techniques to predict stock prices based on historical data. The code in this repository provides a comprehensive workflow for stock price prediction, including data preparation, model training, prediction, and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Import stock data from CSV or Excel files, set a datetime index, and scale features for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train a Linear Regression model to predict stock prices, with options to adjust the training and testing data split ratio.
- **Prediction**: Forecast future stock prices and inverse the scaling for interpretable results.
- **Comparison and Visualization**: Compare predicted prices with actual values (if comparison data is available) and visualize the results using bar charts.
